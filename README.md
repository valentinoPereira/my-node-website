# my-node-website
This is my website in core nodejs. This is my personal website, which you can say its my portfolio website.

I have tried experimenting NodeJS without using the express framework. So all the code you will see is in *Core NodeJS*.
I have tried to avoid using any libraries, and the ones which are used in this repository are super important ones, because core NodeJS does not support that functionality.

Pre-requisites:-
1) NodeJS and npm

Steps to run:-
1) Clone the repository.
2) Open the directory in which you have cloned the website in your command line.
3) Run "npm install" command.
4) Create a ".env" file in your project root with the same variables as there are in the ".env.example" file, but with your credentials.
5) Run the app using "npm start" in you command line, and open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser .
