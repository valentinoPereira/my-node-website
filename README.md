# my-node-website
This is my website in core nodejs. This is my personal website, which you can say its my portfolio website.

I have tried experimenting NodeJS without using the express framework. So all the code you will see is in *Core NodeJS*.
I have tried to avoid using any libraries, and the ones which are used in this repository are super important ones, because core NodeJS does not support that functionality.

Pre-requisites:-
1) NodeJS and npm

Steps to run:-
1) Clone the repository.
2) Open the directory in which you have cloned the website in your command line.
3) Run "npm install" command.
4) Create a ".env" file in your project root with the same variables as there are in the ".env.example" file, but with your credentials.
5) Run the app using "npm start".
